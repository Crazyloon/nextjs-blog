## TLDR; Just Give Me the Roadmap!

The roadmap is broken into multiple posts, one for each major topic that is covered. If you're the kind of person that just wants to jump in, [go here](/blog/100-days-of-code-html) to get started.

## Motivation and Background

My wife has been interested in learning web development on-and-off for a couple years now, and we'd worked together to teach her a few things, but as soon as we didn't have a plan laid out she lost interest. Recently, she has expressed interest in learning again, so this time I wanted to find a lesson plan we could use. I've seen people talking about #100DaysOfCode for a couple years now, so I figured someone had probably published a lesson plan for the first 100 days somewhere.

After a little bit of research, however, I couldn't find exactly what I was looking for. There's a great resource [Developer Roadmaps](https://roadmap.sh/frontend) for learning frontend development but it still requires you to decide on a pace of your own and doesn't give a precise order to go through the content. I stumbled upon a [resource](https://github.com/nas5w/100-days-of-code-frontend) that took this roadmap and broke it into 100 days, but it still wasn't quite as detailed as I wanted. So I took the roadmap and some inspiration from nas5w's repo and I produced a series of blog posts which lay out what to do each day for 100 days to become a "hireable" front end developer.

Now to be fair, 100 days is not enough to become a front end developer for the majority of people. Learning anything new is hard, and learning abstract ideas required to become developer are even more so. If you want to follow my 100 days plan and you find it helpful, please feel free to let me know on [Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/realcrazyloon). Please also leave feedback if you think it will improve the journey for someone else.

## Forward

To kick things off, I want to be clear that this is not a "course" on web development. I will not be directly teaching you how to code, though I may leave some nuggets of wisdom scattered along the trail. Instead, I will provide you with a path to getting started, and you will be expected to use it to develop the habits that will set you on your journey to creating cool things for fun and for profit.

Throughout the next 100 days, I will expect you to watch videos, take tutorials, read articles and documentation ðŸ˜±, and most importantly, practice. I won't hold your hand, but I'll keep your compass pointed North, and I'll provide that direction with _**100% free**_ resources only.

Don't let anyone fool you. Becoming a hirable web developer in 100 days is a massive challenge; it will require an extreme level of dedication. But you don't have to become hirable in 100 days; for most people, the first 100 days will only prove your commitment to learning the craft. You will need many more days, potentially even a couple years, to become hirable. This is absolutely normal. I spent 4 years learning software development before someone wanted to hire me. There are definitely stories of people who have landed jobs in tech after very short time-spans, but trust me when I tell you that they are outliers. Most people have spent years learning this stuff, and even when you land a job, you'll never stop learning. I don't want you scare you away, but I want you to mentally prepare yourself for the next steps. If you take those steps methodically, one day at a time, you'll build the confidence you need to keep going to 1000 days or 10,000 days.

In order to succeed in this industry, you will need to learn patience, you will have to learn how to struggle with a problem and find answers on your own. You will need to learn Google-Fu and become an expert and describing your problem to both search engines, and other people. You must learn to be comfortable sitting in front of a computer for as much as 8 hours per day, and sometimes more.

Some words of wisdom before you embark on this journey... You don't have to be the most intelligent person, you don't need a four-year degree, you don't have to enjoy writing code outside of work, and you don't have to stay up to date on every new library that comes out. The world needs people who are comfortable writing code during their work-day before going home to think about anything but code, and it also needs people who eat, sleep, and breath code 24 hours a day. You can be anywhere in between and still be valuable and successful. The world of programming needs you!
