## Background

I originally wrote this guide to help my wife get interested in tech. When we met, she had no idea what code looked like. She has worked customer support and is familiar with Windows computers and applications, she's on Facebook more often than either of us would like to admit, and she's a huge fan of IPhone and Mac. All that to say that she's not completely new to the world of tech, but she couldn't write a line of HTML until I got her interested in web development. It was so enjoyable to see her eyes light up as she built her first page about how to care for Shih Tzus.

As of writing this, she has not yet completed her 100 days of code, but she's enjoying the ride so far, and that's all that matters. If she wants to work toward a career in tech after this, I'll be there to help her. Otherwise, she will have made a great guinea pig for this guide ‚ù§Ô∏è.

## Introduction

Welcome to **Zero to Web Developer in 100 Days**. Before anything else, you must understand that learning is hard. Most people struggle to learn new concepts, and programming is one of the more challenging things you can learn. I will not be the one to directly teach you how to code, instead I will provide a path to success. I will expect you to watch video lectures, tutorials, crash courses, deep dives. I will link you to free online interactive courses, and I also will ask you to read almost every day. You'll read many articles, even üò± documentation. I won't hold your hand, but I'll point you in the right direction, and I'll provide that direction with 100% free resources only.

Don't let anyone fool you. Becoming a hirable web developer in 100 days is a massive challenge; it will require an extreme level of dedication. But you don't have to become hirable in 100 days; for most people, the first 100 days will only prove your commitment to learning the craft. You will need many more days, potentially even a couple years, to become hirable. This is absolutely normal. I spent 4 years learning software development before someone wanted to hire me. There are definitely stories of people who have landed jobs in tech after very short time-spans, but trust me when I tell you that they are outliers. Most people have spent years learning this stuff, and once you land a job, you'll never stop learning.

In order to succeed in this industry, you will need to learn patience, you will have to learn how to struggle with a problem and find answers on your own. You will need to learn Google-Fu and become an expert and describing your problem to both search engines, and other people. You must learn to be comfortable sitting in front of a computer for as much as 8 hours per day, and sometimes more.

Some words of wisdom before you embark on this journey... You don't have to be the most intelligent person, you don't need a four-year degree, you don't have to enjoy writing code outside of work, and you don't have to stay up to date on every new library that comes out. The world needs people who are comfortable writing code during their work-day before going home to think about anything but code, and it also needs people who eat, sleep, and breath code 24 hours a day. You can be anywhere in between and still be valuable and successful. The world of programming needs you!
