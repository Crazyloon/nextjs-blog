## Background

I've been working as a software developer at a major consulting firm in the Seattle area for the past 4 years. I interned with them when I was in college, and got hired immediately after. The company itself has been fine to work for and I enjoy "working" with my colleagues (I say that in quotes because in my experience, I haven't actually worked on the same projects as anyone else). As a corporate-employed consultant you don't often get paid the big bucks that you might see elsewhere in tech. Part of that is because the price of your contract also has to pay for the work of other internal employees who don't directly generate revenue. At my employer, in return for a lower salary, you don't have to worry about always having a client, because you will still get paid if you're "non-chargeable", while the business finds a client for you. It's a great place to enter the field because there's lots unique work going on that you can explore, clients treat you as an expert (for better or worse), and you can really drink straight from the fire-hose if you position yourself well. However, It's my company has the business model of putting a butt in a chair whether that person contributes or not. If a contract says you need 10 butts but the work only requires 6, there are 4 butts sitting around tootin' their whistles. I'm not going to argue the merits of this structure of work - it is what it is. I'm just going to talk about my experience working in this environment for the past 4 years, some of the benefits I've noticed, the lessons I've learned and my hopes for the future.

## My First Role

When I joined the company, it took a couple months to land my first project. It kind of sucked because I was eager to prove myself, but it wasn't the worst situation. I got to spend all of my time studying and exploring new tech - it was like getting paid to go to school for 8 hours a day. When I finally landed my first client, I ended up working on a Telecom website, using a bunch of tools I had little to no experience with, it was actually a great position for me. I had a lead who was intelligent and helpful, I learned a lot about the tech, but more importantly, I learned what it was like to work on a large scale project with many different business units vying for their upgrades to be in the next sprint. I was picking things up quickly, and the client was very satisfied with my work. So satisfied in fact, that my contract was extended every 3 months for a total of 18 months. For this, I was rewarded with an extension cord and a letter of recognition for "Most Extensions"! It was obviously a gag gift (don't let that upset you), but it felt good to get recognized for something on my first project.

Right around the time I started to feel like I was stagnating, the client eventually had to cancel our contract. They were going through some chapter 13 bankruptcy stuff, and my contract was too expensive to keep me on the team. My lead was trying to get me to join their company, and I was tempted by the promise of a $35k pay increase, but I wasn't about to drive 3-4 hours per day just for that, when the company might go under or have to lay me off later anyway. I figured I'd be able to work through some promotions and get near that number pretty soon anyway. I stayed at the consultancy, and quickly found another assignment.

## Some Projects are Worse than Others

My next project, however, was not what I expected. It was interesting initially, but that fizzled out quickly. I was using a different stack, and I had to lead a couple of offshore resources in maintaining a forecasting application for a major mining company. I was happy to learn new tools, learn about a new industry, and I was getting leadership experience too. After our first two months though, the client was happy with the application as-is and didn't want us to make any further updates. I asked my PM to put me somewhere else so I could do some actual work, but it became clear that they were more interested in having me as a butt in a chair, rather than giving me the responsibilities I'd trained for. They didn't want me drop and find a new client when they were still getting paid. I ended up working triage and support for about 4 more months. It was incredibly boring and unfulfilling. I was still relatively new to consulting, so I wasn't immediately alarmed. The role only lasted 6 months in total, so at least it was over quickly.

## Lulled in by a Sense of Creative Control

My next gig started out great. The interview process went like this: <br /> "Do you know how to write APIs in C#?" <br />"yes." <br />"Ok, you start next Monday." <br />I had a ton of creative control on this project because it was small enough that I could fill every role. I designed and built the UI, developed the API, gathered requirements, and hosted the applications, but I was also isolated. Except for my interactions with the clients, I was working alone. Even still, it was great to experience all the different roles and see what it would be like to be a freelance consultant. Because I got to choose what the application was built with, I got to try out Blazor WASM for the first time. I learned a ton in those three months, and I thoroughly enjoyed myself!

Only too soon, reality struck again. Development of that application was wrapping up and we started having talks with the client about a major lift-and-shift project. They needed to migrate an Excel/VBA application to a WPF/C# application. The original developer had sadly developed ALS, and was losing his ability to function. Unfortunately, he was also the sole developer of this application, and it had become a critical element in their daily activities. It essentially took a task that originally took 8+ hours, and automated it into something that could be done in 10-15 minutes.

## The Challenge Ahead

The problem is, this application has organically grown over 8 years and was never designed to become the monster that it is. It has hundreds of global variables and although there are only under 20k lines of code. There are functions over 1000 lines long that do 10 different things, on top of that, there are no real data structures. Instead of reading data into a list for example, the application targets a cell, uses offsets to check for specific data that was entered, then continues to the next row until it finds an empty row. The conditional branching regularly goes 5+ if-statements deep and there are loops within loops within loops. The final challenge, on top of all this, is that the client does not want to provide anyone with business knowledge to be part of the daily code conversion and architectural discussions.

So here's my position, at this point I'm about 2.5 years into my career, I'm still feeling painfully novice as a developer and I'm being asked to architect the rewrite of this nightmare of an application into a technology I've never used. I'm regularly pushed to provide estimates of how long it would take to rewrite this thing, what size team we would need and the individual skills required, the risks we'll have to avoid, and all the while I'm constantly reminding my leadership that I am not qualified to do all of this work and I need someone who can help. My requests are not falling on deaf ears, but it's hard to find developers with the skills required to do all of this. Eventually, they hire a lead who is supposed to take over, but we quickly find out that his skill-set was poorly vetted and they hired a DevOps engineer who, despite being nearly 15 years my senior, had no better ideas for how to approach this problem than I. Leadership continued to search for his replacement. Meanwhile, they brought on a few developers and set us to work building a "POC" to show that we could indeed convert the code to C# and build a working application in WPF.

## Moving Beyond the POC

For three months, I did my best and lead this team toward building a WPF prototype that showed our ability to convert this application onto a new platform. Surprisingly, that prototype worked well enough to convince the client that spending over a million dollars on this conversion was going to be worth it. The expectation was that we would convert the existing logic from VBA to C# as closely as we could, and migrate external data sources from spreadsheets into a SQL database. It would have to support several additional features and we would work under a time and resources contract that would get extended every 3 months until the project was complete, or client lost interest.

At this point, I had warned the client about this rewrite a couple times. I explained that I didn't see any value in a 1:1 conversion, that the problem of maintaining this is not that it's written in VBA, but that no one understands what it's actually doing because it's so spaghettified. The focus needed to be on providing multiple SMEs to help us understand what problem the application solves so we could rewrite small pieces of the application in a form that was more easily understood one bit at a time. It would take more time and remove valuable resources from other projects, but it was the only way they were going to begin to future proof this application.

The client ignored all of this of course, and my leadership wanted me to keep my mouth shut so the client would sign the contract. They were more interested in building the thing the client wanted rather than what the client needed - câ€™est la vie.

Eventually, we did find a replacement for the project lead. He had all the skills we needed to build the infrastructure and UI, but, unfortunately, he severely lacked leadership skills. Although he was my "lead" I still had to spearhead discussions with the client, meet each evening with the offshore team, lead discussions with internal leadership teams. Everyone kind of just decided I was the de-facto lead at this point, despite being more than 15 years his junior. This seemed to be a relief for him, and my internal leadership didn't seem to care one-way or the other who was in charge, so I just went with the flow.

## Seeing on the Brighter Side

Initially, I wasn't happy about it, but it started to work out pretty well. My "lead" was able to keep his mind in the code and build out the infrastructure and UI instead of being distracted by meetings and all the other tasks you have to deal with when working with clients. Whenever I had technical questions, I could still rely on him to provide help. I kept our offshore team on track, converting the VBA to C#, and I handled all the code-reviews and mentorship to keep them productive. As of this writing, we're not done with the application yet, but we're closing in on the final stretch. We're ahead by over a month in the code conversion, and the infrastructure is only slightly behind.

In retrospect, this pattern has been emergent throughout my life. No one seems to want to lead a team, and I often have to step in to fill that position. I'm still not quite sure why this tends to happen often. I don't generally wish to be a leader, but I do enjoy helping others achieve their goals. What I really want to focus on, though, is learning to become a great developer who can bang out projects and jump around to different teams, mentoring people and helping them advance their careers. In order to make this a reality, I need the technical experience first. Only then can consistently provide valuable wisdom. Hopefully, my next project is different, otherwise I may need to look elsewhere for a role that better suits my goals. While I haven't always enjoyed the ride, and I haven't always been learning the skills I really want to focus on, I've gained other valuable skills and experience.
