<Roadmap />

By now, you've made your way through a fair amount of HTML, and you should be able to build a page with some text, media, and hyper-links. But it was mostly just stacked one thing on top of the other without any form of strategic placement, and virtually no color. Enter <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>. CSS allows you to do amazing things like control the layout of your content, change the color and shape of elements, give them interesting animations and breed character in your pages. CSS is a very powerful tool, but it's also a challenge to learn. According to the <acronym title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</acronym> there are over [500 CSS Properties](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/all-properties.en.html) ðŸ¤¯. Truthfully, I don't know if much more than half of those are actually supported in modern browsers, but if you want a big list to look at that shows some examples, I'd start with my favorite resource: [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference#index).

The reality is, once you've learned about the box-model, how to build some standard layouts, add colors, borders, shadows, and some basic animations, you'll be well on your way to building pages with an organized presentation. If CSS deeply satisfies you, the rabbit hole goes a long way down.

This video moves quickly, so don't expect to absorb a bunch of details from it. I recommended when you're first staring out learning anything, that you gloss over a bunch of surface level information quickly so that you can find the things you think are interesting and dive deeper into each of those topics. I liken it to skimming a table of contents and skipping to the first chapter that catches your interest.
