I've been working as a software developer at a major consulting firm in the Seattle area for the past 4 years. The company itself has been fine to work for and I enjoy "working" with my colleagues (I say that in quotes because in my experience, I don't actually work on the same projects as anyone else). As a corporate-employed consultant you don't often get paid the big bucks that you might see elsewhere in tech. Part of that is because the price of your contract also has to pay for the work of other internal employees who don't directly generate revenue. In return for a lower salary, you don't have to worry about always having a client, you will still get paid if you're "unemployed", while the business finds a client for you. It's a great place to enter the field because there's lots unique work going on that you can explore, clients treat you as an expert (for better or worse), and you can really drink straight from the fire-hose if you position yourself well. However, It's also a company with the business model of putting a butt in a chair whether that person contributes or not - if a contract says you need 10 butts but the work only requires 6, there are 4 butts sitting around tootin' their whistles. I'm not going to argue the merits of this structure of work - it is what it is. I'm just going to lay out what it has been like to work in this environment for the past 4 years, and how it has shaped me.

When I joined the company, it took a couple months to land my first project. It sucked because I was eager to prove myself, but it wasn't terrible, because I got to spend time studying and exploring new tech - it was like getting paid to go to school for 8 hours a day. When I finally landed my first client, I ended up working on a Telecom website using a bunch of tools I'd never used before. It was actually a great experience. I had a lead who was intelligent and helpful, I learned a lot of new stuff, the client was very satisfied with my work. So satisfied in fact, that my contract was extended every 3 months for a total of 18 months. I was rewarded with an extension cord and a letter of recognition for "Most Extensions" (it was obviously a gag gift, don't let that "gift" upset you). Right around the time I started to feel like I was stagnating, the client eventually had to cancel our contract because we were too expensive and they were going through some chapter 13 bankruptcy issues. My lead was trying to get me to join their company, and I might have, because it would likely have come with a 75% pay increase, but I wasn't about to drive 3-4 hours per day for tons of money with the additional fear of the company's bankruptcy plan putting them under. I stayed at the consultancy, and quickly found another assignment.

My next project, however, was not what I expected. It was interesting initially, but that fizzled out quickly. I was using a different stack, and I had to lead a couple of offshore resources in maintaining a forecasting application for a major mining company. I was happy to learn new tools, learn about a new industry, and I was getting leadership experience, but after our first two months, the client was happy with the application as-is and didn't want us to make any further updates. I asked my PM to put me somewhere else so I could do some actual work and it became clear that they were more interested in having me as a butt in a chair, rather than giving me the responsibilities I'd trained for or letting me drop and find a new client. I ended up working triage and support for about 4 more months. It was incredibly boring and unfulfilling. I was still relatively new to consulting, so I wasn't immediately alarmed. The role only lasted 6 months in total, so at least there's that.

My next gig started out great. The interview process went like this: "Do you know how to write APIs in C#?" "yes." "Ok, you start next Monday." On this project, I had a ton of freedom, but I was also isolated. I was working alone, except for my interactions with the clients. It was cool because I got to experience what it would be like to be a freelance consultant. I had to schedule the meetings with the client, discover the requirements, design the architecture (it was a simple project, don't let me fool you), choose the tools and technology, set up the web servers, and host the API and web app. I learned so much in three months - it was great!

Then, reality hit again. Development of that application was wrapping up and we started having talks with the client about a major lift-and-shift project. They needed to migrate an Excel/VBA application to a WPF/C# application. The original developer, sadly developed ALS, and was losing his ability to function. Unfortunately, he was the sole developer of this application, and it had become a crucial element in their daily activities. It essentially took a task that originally took 8+ hours, and automated it into something that could be done in 10-15 minutes.

The problem is, this application has organically grown over 8 years and was never designed to become the monster that it is. It has hundreds of global variables and although there are only under 20k lines of code. There are functions over 1000 lines long that do 10 different things, on top of that, there are no real data structures. Instead of reading data into a list for example, the application targets a cell, uses offsets to check for specific data that was entered, then continues to the next row until it finds no more data. The conditional branching regularly goes 5+ if-statements deep and there are tons of loops within loops within loops. The final challenge, on top of all this, is that the client does not want to provide anyone with business knowledge to be part of the daily code conversion and architectural discussions.

So here's my position, at this point I'm about 2.5 years into my career, I'm still feeling painfully novice as a developer and I'm being asked to architect the rewrite of this nightmare of an application into a technology I've never used. I'm regularly pushed to provide estimates of how long it would take to rewrite this thing, what size team we would need and the individual skills required. What risks we'll have to avoid, and all the while I'm constantly reminding my leadership that I am not qualified to do all of this work and I need someone who can help. My requests are not falling on deaf ears, but it's hard to find developers with the skills required to do all of this. Eventually, they hire a lead who is supposed to take over, but we quickly find out that his skill-set was poorly vetted and they hired a DevOps engineer who, despite being nearly 15 years my senior, had no better clue how to approach this problem than I. Leadership continued to search for his replacement, meanwhile they brought on a few developers and set us to work building a "POC" to show that we could indeed convert the code to C# and build a working application in WPF.

I did my best to lead this team for 3 months, toward building a WPF prototype that showed our ability to convert this application onto a new platform. Surprisingly, that prototype worked well enough to convince the client that spending over a million dollars on this conversion was going to be worth it. The expectation was that we would convert as closely as we could to identical code structure as the original, but make sure it was in C#/WPF and could extract external data sources from spreadsheets into a SQL database. It would have to support several additional features and we would work under a time and resources contract that would get extended every 3 months until the project was complete, or they lost interest.

At this point, I had warned the client about this rewrite a couple times. I explained that I didn't see any value in a 1:1 conversion, that the problem of maintaining this is not that it's written in VBA, but that no one understands what it's actually doing because it's so spaghettified. The focus needed to be on providing multiple SMEs to help us understand what problem the application solves so we could rewrite small pieces of the application in a form that was more easily understood one bit at a time. It would take more time and remove valuable resources from other projects, but it was the only way they were going to begin to future proof this application.

All of this fell on deaf ears of course, and my leadership wanted me to shut up, and the client to sign a contract. They were more interested in building the thing the client wanted rather than what the client needed.

Eventually, we did get a replacement for the lead on the project. He had all the skills we needed to build the infrastructure and UI in WPF and SQL, but he severely lacked leadership skills. Although he was my "lead" I still had to lead discussions with the client, lead our nightly offshore team, lead discussions with internal leadership teams, and everyone kind of just decided I was the de-facto lead. This seemed to be a relief for him, and my internal leadership didn't seem to care one-way or the other who was in charge.

Initially, I wasn't happy about it, but it started to work out pretty well. My "lead" was able to stay head-down in the code and build out the infrastructure and UI as necessary, and I was able to let him do his thing instead of being distracted by meetings and all the other tasks you have to deal with when working with clients. I kept our offshore team on track, converting the VBA to C#, and I handled all the code-reviews and mentorship required to get them to produce something usable. We're not done with the application yet, but we're closing in on the final stretch.

While I haven't always enjoyed the ride, and I haven't been learning the skills I really want to focus on, I've gained other valuable skills. My conversion team is ahead by over a month, and the infrastructure team is only slightly behind.

In retrospect, this pattern has been emergent throughout my life. No one seems to want to step up and lead a team, and I often have to step in to fill that position. What I really want, is to be a great developer who can bang out projects and jump around to different teams, mentoring people and helping them advance their careers, but I need the technical experience first, so I can accurately provide valuable wisdom. Getting stuck on projects like this don't give me the sense that I'm advancing my technical skills. Hopefully, my next project is different, otherwise I may need to look elsewhere for a role that better suits my goals.
